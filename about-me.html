    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>My name is Ahmed, and I am a passionate self-taught web developer currently living in the Dagahaley refugee camp in Kenya. Originally from Somalia, I’ve always believed in the power of technology to change lives even in the most challenging situations.</p>
    <p>I began learning web development with limited resources, using just HTML at first, and gradually building my skills through practice and dedication. I’m focused on creating clean, user-friendly websites and turning ideas into real, functional web pages.</p>
    <p>My goal is to continue growing as a developer, build a strong portfolio, and eventually work online full-time. I enjoy learning, helping others, and using technology to improve my future.</p>
